## What is Escrow

An escrow deal is a financial arrangement where a third party, called the escrow agent/arbitor, holds and regulates the payment of funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. This helps ensure security by keeping the payment safe until all the terms of the agreement are met

## How it works

1. Sellers sign up with phone numbers and enlist their products

2. Auto create seller wallet addresses using their phone numbers (optional)

3. Buyer starts escrow deal for a product

4. Buyer deposits money to arbitor

5. Seller delivers product

6. If buyer is happy with product he approves it then funds are automatically transferred from arbitor account to seller account

7. If buyer rejects product he/she returns it then funds are moved from Arbitor back to buyer
